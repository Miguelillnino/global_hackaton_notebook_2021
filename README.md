# Qiskit Global Hackaton 2021
### VARIATIONAL QUANTUM CIRCUITS IN A PROTEIN NETWORK GRAPH
##### To map biochemical interactions inside a 3D-protein structure into a graph network to find bounding amino acids function using a VQA
### Objectives
- To find bounding amino acids function on a delimited network graph approach that characterized a chemical structure using a variational quantum circuit.
- To apply quantum circuits used in graph theory and optimization problems to map 3D-protein structure into chemical interaction network.
- Using the QAOA variational form to find an approximate solution for the protein folding quadratic program.
- To encourage people to push into quantum computing and solve real molecular biology problems faster than classical methods.
